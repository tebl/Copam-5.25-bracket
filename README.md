# Copam+ 5.25 bracket

I was missing the bracket, and it's matching part to lock it into place, that
is needed to install a drive into an old 386 computer of mine. The computer is
a Copam+ 386SXM/16 and while it's fast coming up on 30 years old I've taken it
into my care and hope to keep it running for quite a few more years, giving it
the love its budget status never previously afforded it. The bracket should fit
other Copam+ computers of the same era so if you have one and a 3d-printer, then
there should be no reason not to install that 5.25" floppy drive into it anymore.
